but an alternative theory, (and because Latin scholars do this 
sort of thing) someone tracked down a 1914 Latin edition of 
De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims 
and suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was but recent but the 
20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out
 of room on page 34 for the Latin phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow
 in itself). Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling 
 with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”.
